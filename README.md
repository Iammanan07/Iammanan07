# Weather Prediction Classification Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a classification algorithm for a weather prediction system. The goal is to analyze historical weather data and predict specific weather categories, such as `Sunny`, `Rainy`, `Cloudy`, or `Stormy`, based on input features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

The system is built using Python and leverages machine learning techniques to train a model on historical data and evaluate its performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline (handling missing values, normalization, encoding categorical features).
- Support for multiple classification algorithms, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of model performance.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - xgboost (optional)

## Dataset
This project uses a sample weather dataset containing historical data with the following features:

| Feature           | Description                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Temperature       | Daily temperature in Celsius  |
| Humidity          | Percentage of humidity        |
| Wind Speed        | Wind speed in km/h            |
| Atmospheric Pressure | Atmospheric pressure in hPa |
| Weather Condition | Target label (Sunny, Rainy, etc.) |

You can replace the dataset (`data/weather_data.csv`) with your own CSV file as long as it follows a similar structure.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for training. Missing values and anomalies should be handled before running the script.

2. **Training the Model:**
   Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Customizing the Algorithm:**
   Modify the `config.json` file to switch algorithms or adjust hyperparameters. Example:
   ```json
   {
       "algorithm": "RandomForest",
       "hyperparameters": {
           "n_estimators": 100,
           "max_depth": 10
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Results and Visualization:**
   Check the `results/` directory for evaluation metrics and visualizations, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
